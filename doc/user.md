# Users' Guide for `proc_profiler`

## Installation

The recommended way of setting up the project is through [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/), which is a general-purposed user-level package management system.

```{hint}
Since the environment is large, it make take tens of minutes for Conda to resolve the dependencies. You are recommended to use [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/) as a drop-in replacement of Conda, which is faster.
```

You may also use PIP-based virtual environment providers like [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html) or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io).
